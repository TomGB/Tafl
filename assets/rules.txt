Black is attacking and goes first, white is defending it's King (the pink piece in
the middle).

To win black must surround the King on 4 sides or white must reach one of the
four corners with its King.
Pieces may move any distance in a strait line, horizontally or vertically,
unless another piece blocks its path.

Only the King may sit in the red spaces.

To take an enemy piece, on your turn surround it on opposite sides with
two pieces.

The red spaces count as enemy pieces when it is not your turn and can be

used in capturing either side, unless the King is on it in which case it counts as
white only.
